# Documentation for Dappradar Registration

## Introduction to DappRadar

[DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/) was started in 2018 with the goal of delivering high quality, accurate insights on decentralized applications to a global audience and rapidly became the go-to, trusted industry source. Since then, DappRadar has become a defacto standard for DApp discovery with more than ten thousand applications listed over twenty protocols. In their own words, *“Across the globe consumers are discovering dapps and managing their NFT/DeFi portfolios with **[DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/)**
. We’re visited by over 500,000 users* every month, our data powers leading industry partners and our quarterly reports are the trusted authority on multichain dapp market insight.”*

Shiden are [now live on DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/blog/shiden-network-dapps-now-on-dappradar). DappRadar maintains homepages for [the top Shiden DApps](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/shiden). Astar will follow very soon on this track. 
(Dapps can already be able to register to DappRadar.)
